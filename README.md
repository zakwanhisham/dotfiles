This is just a backup and also simple step for configuring the new machine.

We still need to download our own packages and plugins to make it work, but this is the gist of it.

Can use `ansible` or make a shell script, but to lazy to do it right now, maybe later?

## Interesting things to do

- Reminder: Need to use `nvm` next time, don't just download npm from repo
- Building from source is the best options
  - Build `Neovim` from source
  - Build `Zig` from source
- Need to configure back `arch-linux` using the `arch-wiki`. Maybe can do after finishing the job?
- Next time just use `bash` instead of `zsh`
  - Use the simplest thing to make the system faster and to avoid things from breaking
- After finishing the nvim config use bob as the neovim source, easier to update and source
