This is just a backup and also simple step for configuring the new machine.

## Interesting things to do

- Reminder: Need to use `nvm` next time, don't just download npm from repo
- Need to configure back `arch-linux` using the `arch-wiki`. Maybe can do after
  finishing the job?
- After finishing the nvim config use bob as the neovim source, easier to update
  and source

## TODO

- [ ] Install `zedmono nerd font` when it is available on arch repo

## Install from pkglist.txt

paru --pacman pacman -S - < pkglist.txt
